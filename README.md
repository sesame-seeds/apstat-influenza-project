# apstat-influenza-project
This is a small project about influenza (the flu) that I completed for my statistics class. The question being answered is "Why do influenza symptoms vary?"

# Sampling Procedure
Please note that the sampling procedure I used is really scuffed and heavily relied on self-reports from those who participated in my survey.

My population for this project was my school. To conduct the survey, I separated the school into stratas. I then made each classroom in each stranum its own cluster.
From each stranum, I randomly selected n number of clusters where n is the number of grades in the stranum (i.e. if a stranum included the 7th and 8th grade, I would randomly select 2 clusters. After I selected which classes I would survey, I decided to randomly select which grade from each class would be surveyed. This way, each cluster would have a roughly homogenous group of participants. Depending on your population, these processes may vary and in some cases be omitted; It's only crucial that each cluster behaves as a representative for a chunk of the population.

The survey was given to everyone on paper. The questions were more of a self-evaluation where they listed their flu-like symptoms they have experienced within the last month and rate the severeness of it on a scale of 1-10. After I received the results, I compiled all of the data in a Excel spreadsheet.
