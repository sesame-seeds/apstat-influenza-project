    <h1>Observations</h1>
    <h2>Visualization</h2>
    <p>I separated each response into two different groups: Group Alpha (vaccinated) and Group Beta (unvaccinated).
      I created box-and-whiskers plots for each group to represent the center and spread of the data.
      Since the data was skewed to the right, I decided to apply a square root transformation to the data to make it approximately normal.
      A cube root would have also been well, but I ultimately stuck with square root transformations to test for significance.</p>

    <h2>Testing for Significance</h2>
    <p>I ran two tests: one 2-Sample t-Test and one 1-Sample t-Test.
    The first test answers the question of whether or not there is a significance difference in mean symptom severity between Group Alpha and Group Beta.</p>

    <p>Based on the results, we do not reject the null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference between the mean symptom severity between
    Group Alpha and Group Beta.</p>

    <p>The next test answers the question of whether or not those who sleep less experience more severe flu symptoms.</p>

    <h2>Conclusions and Thoughts</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, there was not any significant statistical evidence to prove neither questions to be true. Although the p-value observed in Question 2 was relatively closer, it still failed to fall below a significance level of 0.05.</p>

    <h3>What can be improved on?</h3>
    <p>One major flaw in my project was my experiment design. Vaccine research impliments more rigorous experimental design and often relies on hands-on collected data rather than data from surveys.</p>
    <p>If I were to ever repeat this project again, I would definitely improve on my design by collecting data in a more concrete way instead of relying on estimations.</p>
